     <p>History about the this kite :-</p>
     <p>Hargrave box kite, kite designed, built, and flown by the aeronautical pioneer Lawrence Hargrave in the 1890s.</p>

     <p>Hargrave began his experiments with kites in 1893. 
        His goal was to build a kite so efficient that it would advance into the wind. 
        While his efforts to draw propulsive force from the wind were unsuccessful, he did develop a series of critically important cellular-kite designs; 
        provided solid demonstrations of the superiority of cambered, or curved, wing surfaces; and contributed to the understanding of stability in flying machines.</p>
        
     <p>Hargrave published his earliest descriptions of cellular kites, now known as box kites, in 1893.
        While the notion of biplane or multiplane wings can be dated to the work of the English aeronautical pioneer Francis Herbert Wenham, Hargrave added the vertical curtains between the wings, 
        and he was the first actually to build and fly a box kite. 
        Very efficient and capable of carrying relatively heavy weights aloft, Hargrave’s kites had a design that was quickly adapted to lift meteorological instruments high into the air.</p>
        
     <p>Hargrave’s kite designs also played an enormously important role in the subsequent history of flight. 
        They provided a starting point for such leading aeronautical experimenters as Alexander Graham Bell, Charles Lamson, Octave Chanute, and S.F. Cody. 
        The Wright brothers conducted their earliest aeronautical experiments with a cellular kite trussed to demonstrate their wing-warping control system.</p>
