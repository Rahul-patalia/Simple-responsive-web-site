     <p>Some Infomation about Wau Bulan Kite :</p>
     <p>Wau Bulan (Moon Kite) is the most popular and favourite type of Wau in the Malay community.
          It is an intricately designed Wau mainly with floral motifs. If you look at the shape of 
          the Wau Bulan properly, the lower section of the Wau looks like a crescent moon. 
          Therefore, it was called “Wau Bulan”. Given the right colour, when flown, 
          Wau Bulan apparently resembles a rising crescent moon. Another reason why the society referred to 
          it as Wau Bulan is because of its appearance which is like the moon flying high and 
          its size which is definitely larger than any other kite. This makes the decorations painted on 
          the body to be visible when it is flown high in the air. To make it more distinctive, 
          Wau Bulan is normally decorated with large, strong-coloured patterns.
     </p>
     <p>Based on my research, a Wau is usually flown by two people at a time. 
        One person will hold the Wau while the other person called the ‘juru anjung’ or 
        the controller will hold the rope. The juru anjung will pull the strings for a short period of time 
        until the Wau is successfully flown.
