     <p>In 1849, Cayley was testing a triplane design of glider. Its three-layer stack of wings had an elongated 
         hexagonal plan shape, with a cruciform tailplane attached for stability. An open cabin with three 
         lightweight wheels hung below the wings, with its own tailplane for steering. The wings and tailplanes 
         were of linen stretched over a cane frame, braced with wires. The first passenger was a boy, 
         about 10 years old, who flew in the glider for several metres on more than one occasion.
        
     <p>Cayley returned to a monoplane concept for his next manned glider design, which he called 
         The Governable Parachute. His paper about it appeared in Mechanics' Magazine on the 25th September 1852. 
         It had a dihedral wing about 43 sq m in area, uplifted by 8-10 degrees from the horizontal, 
         with a cruciform tailplane attached at one end. In plan, the shape of the wing and tailplane resembled
          an angelfish.</p><hr>
