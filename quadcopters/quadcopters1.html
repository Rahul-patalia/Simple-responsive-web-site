     <p>Information about the Apollo Quadcopter:-</p>
     <p>
        The quadcopter Apollo is an easy to fly model, and has been preassembled and tested in the factory. 
        All you have to do is remove it from the box, charge it up and go.
        The Apollo drone has some great features. Multi-rotor aircraft require complex technology to keep them 
        in the air. It will precisely hover in one position, with the aid of its self-leveling compass and 
        GPS technology. The Apollo has an integrated iFly flight control system that includes a 
        compass, barometer, and GPS. The quad will be able to hover in the air and hold its position.
     </p>
     <p>
        The quadcopter Apollo takes two double AA batteries. It is built with four smooth and brushless motors.
        The quad is built with low voltage protection, so that you wonâ€™t have to worry about your quad crashing 
        because it might run low on power.
     </p>

         You can add on a GoPro action camera or a Boscam FPV camera, or other lightweight camera of any brand.
